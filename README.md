# Ngram Completion Based on Google Ngrams Viewer

This plugin is a helper for Vim completion plugin
[Vimcomplete](https://github.com/girishji/vimcomplete). It suggests (completes)
next word based on bigram, trigram and 4-gram word association by querying [Google Ngrams
Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/). No additional packages or databases are required.

_**Note:** Google ngram queries can be slow and can take over a second. However,
Vim's responsiveness is not affected because queries are asynchronous (`:h job`) and results
are cached. I implemented this out of curiosity but I do not find it very
useful. Your mileage may vary._
